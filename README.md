# Optimizing Credit Card Due Dates Using Customer Payment Behavior

## Project Overview

Many credit card customers pay their bills a few days late, not due to lack of funds, but because the **standardized due dates** don’t align with their **income or cash flow cycles**. This results in:

- Unnecessary **late fees**
- Reduced **customer satisfaction**
- Increased **churn**

This project simulates and analyzes user payment behavior to develop a personalized due date strategy that improves customer experience and reduces late payments.

---

## Objective

Analyze historical payment behavior to:

- Identify how many days users typically delay payments
- Segment users based on their average delay patterns
- Recommend personalized due dates based on behavior
- Improve customer satisfaction, on-time payments, and retention

## Target Stakeholders

| Role              | Interest                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Managers  | Reduce churn and increase user satisfaction            |
| Data Science Team | Build clustering models to segment user behavior       |
| Customer Success  | Lower volume of late fee complaints                    |
| Marketing         | Personalize campaigns and promotions based on segments |

---

## Success Criteria

- Clean and usable synthetic dataset representing payment behavior
- Insightful visualizations showing average delay patterns
- Clustering model to group users into actionable segments
- Recommendations for flexible or personalized due dates

---

## Real-World Relevance

This problem mirrors real-life challenges in the credit and fintech industries. Companies like:

- **American Express**
- **Capital One**
- **Affirm**
- **Afterpay**

...are actively working on or exploring personalized due date models to improve customer loyalty, reduce avoidable late fees, and enhance user experience.

## Reference Use Case / Real-World Applicability

This project uses synthetic data to simulate credit card user payment behavior. However, it is designed as a reference model for real-world deployment within financial institutions or fintech applications.

If real user data is available (e.g., from a bank’s internal transaction system), this project can be adapted to:

- Analyze actual **payment and due date behavior**
- Build **production-ready clustering models**
- Integrate into **billing systems** to dynamically adjust or recommend personalized due dates
- Reduce late payments and improve **customer satisfaction KPIs**

###  Real Data Requirements

| Column          | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`        | Unique customer ID                               |
| `due_date`       | Monthly credit card bill due date                |
| `payment_date`   | Date when payment was actually made              |
| `bill_amount`    | Amount billed                                    |
| `payment_amount` | Amount paid (for full or partial analysis)       |
| *(Optional)*     | `salary_date`, `account_type`, `employment_status` |

This project provides:
- A replicable pipeline with synthetic data
- Reusable clustering & visualization notebooks
- A stakeholder-ready documentation framework
